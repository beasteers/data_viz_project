**Description**: Exploring NYC subway journeys across all lines in the city using MTA GTFS Data Feed from one day in November 2017. We present a visual analytics system for detection, inspection and comparison of spatio-temporal patterns across subways lines. Users can interact with subway map to better understand subway schedules and station information. 

The project aims to provide a beautiful and enjoyable way to explore schedule densities between different lines. With this, you can look at a subway line and see what times it is running and what times it isn't. You can also compare the running times between lines to see at what times a train would be available. The Marey Diagram was chosen for it's intuitive display of the subway schedule.

The dataset used was a sample GTFS Subway feed provided by Google Transit API. The data is of Saturday 11/05/2017.
